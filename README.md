# Restful Booker - API Test Automation Framework

This project is a robust API test automation framework built from scratch in Java to test the [Restful Booker API](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/). It provides a full end-to-end testing solution covering all major CRUD operations and incorporates industry-standard best practices for automation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Full CRUD Coverage:** Automated tests for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on bookings.
- **Automated Authentication:** A `BaseTest` class handles token generation and management automatically before tests run.
- **Professional HTML Reporting:** Generates detailed, shareable HTML test reports using **ExtentReports**, configured via a TestNG listener.
- **Structured Logging:** Uses **Log4j2** for clear, color-coded console output and automatically writes detailed logs to a file (`app.log`).
- **External Configuration:** Manages the base URI and credentials in an external `config.properties` file, allowing tests to run against different environments without code changes.
- **API Client Layer:** A clean separation of concerns between test logic (`BookingTests`) and API interaction logic (`BookingClient`), making the framework highly maintainable and readable.
- **POJO-Based Data Management:** Uses Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) for type-safe and reusable test data.
- **End-to-End Test Flows:** Uses TestNG's `dependsOnMethods` to create realistic user scenarios (e.g., Create ‚Üí Update ‚Üí Delete).
